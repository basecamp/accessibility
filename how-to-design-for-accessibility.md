## 1. Make sure links convey the full context of the action

*Who is this for?* People using a screen reader

When someone using a screen reader lands on a link with a name such as *"click here"*, that's all the screen reader will announce and the context of the action isn't clear. To improve this, wrap the entire line in a link so the full context of the action is conveyed.
