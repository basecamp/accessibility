# How we design and test for accessibility

While working on a new feature it's a great time to find and fix a number of common accessibility issues. The results of these checks is most easily fixed by the team working on the feature, and should therefore happen before the feature is ready for QA.

For some background, there's a split between the sorts of issues that can be detected using an automated accessibility checker, and those which require manually navigating through a page using keyboard navigation (no mouse required!), and again using a screenreader. Then there are higher level evaluations of the design and interactions that come from experience with using assistive technology and understanding the nuance around how people use them.
