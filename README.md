# How we design and test for accessibility

While working on a new feature it's a great time to find and fix a number of common accessibility issues. The issues uncovered by these checks are most easily fixed by the team working on the feature, and should therefore happen before the feature comes to QA.

## Choosing your approach
Accessibility issues come in all shapes and sizes.
1. A subset of accessibility issues can be detected using automated accessibility checkers.
2. Others require manually navigating through a page using keyboard navigation (no mouse required!), and again using a screenreader.
3. Then there are higher level evaluations of the design and interactions that come from experience with using assistive technology and understanding the nuance around how people use them.
